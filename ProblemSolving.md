# Creating a highly available EC2 instance
- Monitor with CloudWatch Event and invoke lambda to scale the EC2 instances.
- Create instances in multiple AZ to increase resiliency.
AWS Lifecycle Hooks are a feature of Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) in Amazon EC2 that enable you to perform custom actions as instances are launched or terminated. 
They provide a way to control or customize the behavior of instances during these transitions.
